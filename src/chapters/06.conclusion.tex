\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}

The primary goal of this thesis was to resolve compatibility of Kdyby packages with new versions of libraries they integrate with. The goal to start checking the packages with a static analysis tool and have them adhere to a coding standard is necessary for maintenance but not as critical for daily usage.

The roadmap chapter~\ref{sec:roadmap} of this thesis covers the architectural changes for Kdyby packages, and only a part of that plan was implemented. Nine of the most popular packages have now versions that support current Nette, Doctrine, and Symfony. Also, one of the packages has been completely decomposed to separate packages that each perform only one job.

Compiling the roadmap was critical for future refactorings because it can be used as a basis for them. By implementing it, many of the open issues will also be resolved. And as of writing this, there are 188 open issues and pull requests that have to be solved or reviewed.

The time estimate for solving just the open issues and pull requests alone is several months of work, and the architectural changes covered by roadmap will take at least half a year to implement.
